# ðŸ’« See Stars âœ¨
A Myndex MicroColor Library. This has standard functions for the standard (piecewise) IEC conversion of sRGB to Y, and the CIE standard Y to L* (Lstar) and back again. The math &amp; constants here reference those of CSS 4 for compatibility.

Use this with [Color Parsley](https://github.com/Myndex/colorparsley) and [Delta Phi Star](https://github.com/Myndex/deltaphistar)

This repo is a luminance-only micro-version of SeeLAB
